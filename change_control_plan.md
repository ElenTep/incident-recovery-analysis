## Change Control Plan

1. **Validation in Sandbox**: All configurations tested in an isolated environment before rollout.
2. **Phased Implementation**: High-risk departments receive changes first.
3. **Approval & Rollback**: All changes require approval and include rollback steps.
4. **User Training**: End users are informed of changes and educated on USB and privilege policies.
